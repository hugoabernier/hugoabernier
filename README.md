I'm an indenpendent consultant with over 30 years of IT experience (that's right, I started working two years before I was born ðŸ˜‹).

I've been working with SharePoint since is was still codenamed **Tahoe** (that's why my blog is called [TahoeNinjas.blog](https://tahoeninjas.blog)) and I still love it.

I've also been using Dynamics 365 since the early days. 

I worked as a management consultant with [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/), where I learned to combine my love for problem solving and geekiness to solve business problems using cool technologies.

People seem to call me when they've tried to implement a software project unsuccessfully two or three times before.

As the self-proclaimed "World's Laziest Developer" and a certified SCRUM Master, I like to teach organizations how to succeed with the least effort possible. 

I'm super-passionate about technology, user experience, and accessibility and I get to travel around the world to [speak about it](https://sessionize.com/bernierh/). I have worked in Canada, the United States, Germany, Finland, Singapore, Hungary, France, and the United Kingdom. 

As a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003624?fullName=Hugo%20Bernier) and a [PnP Team member](https://aka.ms/m365pnp), Hugo has created several PnP reusable controls, property controls, Office365-CLI commands, and many sample web parts and extensions.
