I work at Microsoft as a Cloud Solution Architect. 

I've been working with SharePoint since is was still codenamed **Tahoe** (that's why my blog is called [TahoeNinjas.blog](https://tahoeninjas.blog)) and I still love it.

I've also been using Dynamics 365 since the early days. 

I worked as a management consultant with [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/), where I learned to combine my love for problem solving and geekiness to solve business problems using cool technologies.

As the self-proclaimed "World's Laziest Developer" and a certified SCRUM Master, I like to teach organizations how to succeed with the least effort possible. 

I'm super-passionate about technology, user experience, and accessibility and I get to travel around the world to [speak about it](https://sessionize.com/bernierh/). I have worked in Canada, the United States, Germany, Finland, Singapore, Hungary, France, and the United Kingdom -- among others.

I'm a member of the [Microsoft 365 Patterns and Practices](https://aka.ms/m365pnp) team where, together with the community, we build guidance around using and extending Microsoft 365.

I maintain the [PnP web site](https://aka.ms/m365pnp), and manage (or co-manager) the [SPFx web part samples](https://aka.ms/spfx-webparts), [SPFx extension samples](https://aka.ms/spfx-extensions), [Power App Samples](https://aka.ms/powerapps-samples), [Power Automate Samples](https://aka.ms/powerautomate-samples), [Power Fx Samples](https://aka.ms/powerfx-samples), [Power Virtual Agents Samples](https://aka.ms/powerva-samples), and -- soon -- Power Apps Portal samples, PCF Control Samples. They all feed the [Microsoft Adoption Sample Solution Gallery](https://adoption.microsoft.com/sample-solution-gallery).

I'm also insanely privileged to help [David Warner II](https://github.com/popwarner) on a PnP initiative called [Sharing is Caring](https://aka.ms/sharing-is-caring), where we show people how to contribute to various open-source iniatives with hands-on workshops -- including using GitHub, giving presentations, setting up your workstation, and anything else that we can do to help getting people started.
