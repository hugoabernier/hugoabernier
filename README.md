# Hugo Bernier

Hugo is someone organizations call when their SharePoint and Dynamics 365 projects are doomed to fail and need help to get things back on track.

As the self-proclaimed "World's Laziest Developer" and a certified SCRUM Master, he teaches organizations how to achieve success with the least effort possible. 

Hugo has worked in Canada, the United States, Germany, Finland, Singapore, Hungary, France, and the United Kingdom. 

As a Microsoft MVP and a PnP Team member, Hugo has created several PnP reusable controls, property controls, Office365-CLI commands, and many sample web parts and extensions.
