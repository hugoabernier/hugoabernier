Community-building and public speaking. I hope that what I lack in skills, I make up for with passion."

## I’m Hugo Bernier <br> <strong>The world's laziest developer</strong>

I started working with SharePoint back when it was codenamed **Tahoe** — before it actually became SharePoint 2001. I have been working with it ever since.

This is my least favorite part about blogging: talking about myself. I have no problems talking about the Microsoft Power Platform (especially Power Pages!!!), SharePoint, Dynamics, software development, but I don’t like talking about myself.

I know, I know, I’m supposed to establish my credibility as an expert, blah, blah, blah… but here’s how I see it: read my blog and see for yourself. Maybe I don’t know what I’m talking about, maybe I do. [There’s really no way for me to tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

* * *

I grew up near Quebec City but moved to Toronto to learn to speak English. I have yet to master the English language. I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, or sentences that don’t make sense.

I’m a former McKinsey & Company consultant, but a developer at heart. I use my experience to help bridge the ubiquitous gap between _business_ and _technology_.

I have pretty much worked almost exclusively with Microsoft technologies; Power Pages (and the rest of the Power Platform), Dynamics 365, and SharePoint are some of my favourite things.

I call myself the **World’s Laziest Developer**. I’ll always try to look for ways to use the built-in capabilities of a system before writing custom code. When I resort to custom code, it is because there is no built-in way to do it. Nothing makes me angrier than people writing custom code when they could use out-of-the-box functionality.

I am autistic and have ADHD. I also suffer from impostor's syndrome.

Once in a while, I find myself researching the same thing over and over again; things that I think should be obvious and easy to find, but that no one has bothered to write about (probably because it is so obvious for everyone but me?).

When I finally find the answer, I usually think “I should blog about this”. Actually, the lazy person in me usually thinks “someone else should blog about this”.

The posts in this blog may not be earth-shattering, mind-blowing, original, or interesting to anyone else. It intends to be a series of notes to myself so that I don’t have to search again.

If it also happens to help you, even better!

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please don’t hesitate to [contact me](contact).
