In October of 2021, I decided to switch from a WordPress-based blog to a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-based site. I mean, how can I not?!

I made a backup of my site. Set up my new site, and decided that it was a good time to review and update my site's look and feel, and content.

But first, I had to prepare for the [Microsoft 365 Conference](https://m365conf.com/#!/) in December, then the one in April.

Of course, my WordPress subscription expired while I was in Vegas, and my old content wasn't moved. "I'll get to it when I get home", I foolishly told myself.

> "I'll get to it when I get home"

<cite>-- A foolish me</cite>

But, shortly after I got home, I heard the good news that I got the new job of Community Program Manager for Power Pages (which was not yet [announced](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-the-preview-of-microsoft-power-pages/)).

Between then and my official start date in my new role, I'd have to start planning from my old role as a Senior Cloud Solution Architect; I'd also be helping (albeit in a non-official capacity) prepare for the launch of the new [Microsoft Power Pages Community](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Power-Pages-Community/ct-p/MPPCommunity).

Oh, and somewhere during that whole time I was busy helping with the creation (and the migration) of the [Microsoft 365 Platform Community Blog](https://pnp.github.io/blog/), adding [development containers](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts/wiki/Opening-a-sample-using-a-development-container) to the [SPFx Web Parts repository], and working on some new [Sharing is Caring](https://pnp.github.io/sharing-is-caring/) sessions.

But things are finally getting back to normal -- a little.

Two weeks ago was my first day in my new role. I had to travel to Seattle (for the first time in over 10 years) so I could meet my new team. 

Came back last week. Tested positive for COVID. Rested -- probably more than I have in many, many years -- and now I'm fixing my blog while fighting a fever (the pink elephants are telling me I'm doing a fine job, by the way).

I'll do my best to migrate all my old content -- starting with the most frequently-visited content first -- and keep the original URLs the same.

But until then, thank you for being patient.

Also, thank you for reaching out to tell me that my blog is down.  I knew that people visited my blog (because I saw the traffic stats), but I never quite realized that those "visitors" on my site stats were from real people in the community.

And I certainly never expected to receive so many messages from people telling me that they always rely on my site for so many things.

For something that started as a place to leave notes for myself, I am quite flattered that others find my ramblings useful.

Thank you! As I get back on my feet, so will the content on my blog!
